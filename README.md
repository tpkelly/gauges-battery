Building the project
------------------

In order to build this project you'll need a copy of ShinobiGauges. If you don't have it yet, you can download a free trial from the [ShinobiSuite website](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/ios/shinobisuite/).

If you've used the installer to install ShinobiGauges, the project should just work. If you haven't, then once you've downloaded and unzipped ShinobiGauges, open up the project in Xcode, and drag ShinobiGauges.framework from the finder into Xcode's 'frameworks' group, and Xcode will sort out all the header and linker paths for you.

If you’re using the trial version you’ll need to add your license key. To do so, open up ViewController.m, import <ShinobiGauges/ShinobiGauges.h>, and set the license key inside viewDidLoad: as follows:

	#import <ShinobiGauges/ShinobiGauges.h>

	@implementation ViewController
	
	- (void)viewDidLoad
	{
    	[super viewDidLoad];
		// Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    	
    	[ShinobiGauges setLicenseKey:@""]; // Add license key here
    	...
    }
